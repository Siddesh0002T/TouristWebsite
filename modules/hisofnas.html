            <h1>History Of Nashik</h1><br><br><br>

            <p>Nashik, a city in the northern region of Maharashtra, India, is historically, mythologically, socially, and culturally significant1. It’s known for its temples on the banks of the Godavari and is one of the four cities that host the massive Sinhastha Kumbh Mela once every twelve years1.

                According to Hindu legends, Nashik was known as “Padmanagar” during Satya Yuga, “Trikantak” during Treta Yuga, “Janasthana” during Dvapara Yuga, and “Navashikh” or “Nashik” during Kali Yuga1. During the Mughal period, it was known as “Gulshanabad”, the city of roses1.
                
                Nashik has mythological importance as Lord Rama, the King of Ayodhya, made Nashik his abode during his 14 years in exile1. At the same place, Lord Laxman, by the wish of Lord Rama, cut the nose of “Shurpanakha” and thus this city was named as “Nasik” as the word Nasik means “nose” in Sanskrit1.
                
                Historically, Nashik was included under Ashok’s mighty empire1. Later, Nashik district became very prosperous during the era of the Satavahana as it lay on the trade route to Broach (Gujarat)1. During the Mughal period, the city was named as Gulshanabad1. The old name was restored when Peshwas took over in 17511.
                
                In 150 BCE Nashik was the country’s largest marketplace1. From 1487 CE, the province came under the rule of Mughals1. It was also home of Emperor Akbar who wrote at length about Nashik in Ein-e-Akbari1. It was also known as the ‘Land of the Brave’ during the regime of Maratha Emperor Shivaji1.
                
                The most important historical significance is that Kumbh Mela is conducted at Nashik once every twelve years, out of 4 places in India1. Legend states that the name “Nashik” is derived from the Hindu epic Ramayana. During the exile of Lord Ram, Shoorpanakha, the sister of the demon king Raavan tried to seduce Ram. Angered, Ram ordered Lakshman to cut off Shoorpanakha’s nose ( nashika/naak )1.
                
                According to the Raamayan, Sita was abducted by Raavan from the area called Panchavati in the Western Ghats1. Today, it is a popular religious destination within the city limits1.
                
                On April 19,1818 Nashik surrendered to the British2. During the freedom struggle of 1857, Nashik was the scene of considerable disturbance2. The struggle ended by 1860, and Nashik once again enjoyed peace2. Nashik Municipality was formed in 18642. In 1869, Nashik was made a full fledged District with its present 13 talukas2.
                
                In 1751, the city was taken over by the Peshwas and they gave it the present name of Nashik3. During this period, Raghobadada and his wife AnandibaiPeshwa settled at Anandwali in Nashik3. Later on in 1818, the city was surrendered to the British and got disturbed during the freedom struggle movement of India3.
                
                Today, Nashik is emerging as one of the fastest-growing cities in India4. It’s known as the ‘Wine Capital of India’ as more than half of India’s vineyards and wineries are located here4. Around 90% of all Indian wine comes from the Nashik Valley4.
                
                Nashik is one of the Hindu pilgrimage sites of the Kumbh Mela, which is held every 12 years4. The name, Nashik, is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘nāsikā’ which literally means 'nose’4. According to the Ramayana, Nashik is the location on the banks of the Godavari River where Lakshmana cut the nose of the demoness Surpanakha, hence the name "Nashik."4 It is also known by the name Panchavati4. It was known as “Gulshanabad” during the Mughal period4.
                
                Nashik was known by many names. It was known as “Padmanagar” during the Satya Yuga, “Trikantak” during the Treta Yuga, “Janasthana” during the Dvapara Yuga, and finally “Navashikh” or “Nashik” during the Kali Yuga, according to Hindu traditions4. Nashik is significant in mythology, history, social life, and culture</p>
